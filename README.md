# py-template

A template to bootstrap Python projects following best practices.

## üöÄ How to Use This Template

You can create a new project using this template in **two ways**:

### üîπ Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
Use the `setup.sh` script to automatically download and set up everything.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grok-ai/py-template/main/setup.sh -o setup.sh && bash setup.sh
```

This will:
- Prompt you for a project name
- Install `uv` if not already installed
- Use **Copier** to create a new project
- Set up dependencies automatically

### üîπ Option 2: Manual Setup
If you prefer a **manual setup**, you can install the required tools and run Copier yourself.

#### **üìå Prerequisites**
Before running Copier manually, ensure you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for managing dependencies)

Install it using:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Then, create a new project with:

```bash
uvx copier copy --trust gh:grok-ai/py-template my-new-project
```

### 3. Customize the Project

The script will prompt you for the following configurations:

- **Project Name**: The name of your new project.
- **Python Package Name**: The default Python package name (this will be the directory name in lowercase, no spaces).
- **Description**: A short description of your project.
- **GitHub Username**: Your GitHub username, if you want to push to a GitHub repository.
- **GitHub Project Name**: The name of the GitHub repository, if you want to push to a GitHub repository.
- **License**: Choose a license for your project (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0).
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Choose whether to enable pre-commit hooks for your project.

### 4. Manual Push to GitHub (Optional)

If you did not choose to push to GitHub, you can still manually create the repository later and push the project using the following commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/your/repository

# Push the project
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Development Setup

Once your project is set up, you can manage the dependencies using `uv`. The setup already takes care of installing `uv` for you and creating a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory.
